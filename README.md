# Contact.app

## Introduction

This project was created to understand Hypermedia Driven Application (HDA)

## Notes

1. The first roadblock that i encounter is to use templating language called jinja,
   i was familar with flask.

### Design choice

1. Started with Jinja templating to render the contacts.html template which uses
row.html to show contacts on server.
