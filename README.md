# Contact.app

## Introduction

This project was created to understand Hypermedia Driven Application (HDA)

## Notes

1. The first roadblock that i encounter is to use templating language called jinja,
   i was familar with flask.

### Design choice

1. Started with Jinja templating to render the contacts.html template which uses
row.html to show contacts which are present on server.
2. Decided to use sqlite3 as file base database, as it simple to start with.
3. Need to validate emails are unique in contacts table
